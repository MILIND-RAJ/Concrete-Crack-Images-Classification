# Concrete-Crack-Images-Classification
Created a Deep Learning model using Keras to predict whether an image of concrete surface has a crack in it. The model is trained using existing deep learning models namely VGG16 and resnet50. Also the comparison based on the performance of these two models is made.
## Installation

We need numpy, pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras python libraries for creating and evaluating the model. We need to create Python 3 kernel in Jupyter Notebook

## Project Motivation
Compared the performance of two very famous deep learning classification models namely VGG16 and resnet50 

## File Descriptions

There is one Jupyter notebook available to show the code, used to train and evaluate the models . The notebook easily explains the above question.  

## Results
Both the models performed upto the mark and there is no large performance difference is seen between two models.


## Dataset
Find the link to the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/thesighsrikar/concrete-crack-images-for-classification
The dataset contains 3 folders
### 1.Train
Train folder contains two folders negative(Images without cracks) and positive(Images with cracks) each folder has 15000 images each.
### 2.Test
Test folder contains two folders negative(Images without cracks) and positive(Images with cracks) each folder has 250 images each to test the models.
### 3.Valid
Valider contains two folders negative(Images without cracks) and positive(Images with cracks) each folder has 4750ges each for validation.
